    <h3>Sunday School Hymn</h3>
    <pre>
1. O Sunday School, on the Lord's day,  
O how I love Thee well,  
I am happy, it makes me glad  
To rejoice at Thy birth.

2. O Sunday School, on the Lord's day,  
Thy friendship suits me well;  
Both young and old will sing Thy song,  
We long for Sunday School.

3. O Sunday School, on the Lord's day,  
Christ was Thy first teacher;  
The Holy Spirit, great teacher,  
Does manifest in thee.

4. O Sunday School, on the Lord's day,  
This testimony is sure,  
That God, the Father Almighty,  
Poured His blessing on Thee.

5. O Sunday School, on the Lord's day,  
Though the sun be so bright,  
Or if the clouds be black with rain,  
I'll be in Sunday School.

6. O Sunday School, on the Lord's day,  
I rejoice to see Thee,  
Will thou pass over me today?  
Without my being blest?
